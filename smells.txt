1. this type of smell is a dispensable. the refactoring that can be
applied is extracting the code or creating a function manually.
3. this type of smell is innapropriate intimacy
4. this can be fixed with an internal for loop that breaks when it
does what it is supposed to then has a method to break the outer loop
as well
6. the duplicate code was found in src/test/java/hudson/model/RunParameterDefinitionTest.java
I extracted the code that was in the functions that had to do with
creating a project in testNULLfilter and testALLfilter and created
a new function called testHelper that simply made a function that
created project
